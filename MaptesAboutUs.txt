<p>Maptes Advanced Projects LLC is a Missouri Registered Private U.S. Limited Liability Company,
 run day to day by a Managing Partner who is the Chief Executive and Founder, and composed of
 two Senior partners (with the Managing Partner for the "top 3"), Junior Partners, and
 consultants.</p>

<p> This structure, combined with well designed organization and processes, allow for quick
 decisions, fast turn-around of contracts and opportunities, and effective and efficient
 response not available in other groups.</p></br></br>

<h1>WHY YOU WANT US ON YOUR SIDE</h1><hr>
<p>We are composed entirely of experts. We do not send inexperienced, wet behind the ears,
 newbies on our tasks, 
but instead draw from the long experience of both our partners and associates in a wide
 variety of high technical fields. 
When a Maptes Consultant Team (or Individual) arrives for your effort, 
know that either they are one of the partners, or a consultant that we personally know has the
 required expertise, 
and has proven their skills to us in previous associations. Our engineer-consultants have cut
 their teeth on the biggest backbones on the Internet, including those that are likely carrying
 this web traffic.They have done everything from Tier I ISPs, to government research networks,
 to small and large LANs and WANs.  
We pay our consultants well, and they like us, feel personally obligated to deliver. 
After every fixed term job, or periodically for long term consulting, our VP-Sales and
 Marketing will personally contact you for an honest assessment of our services. We live
 primarily by those who can vouch for our expertise. We also take small efforts that other
 companies leave on the table, to large projects that require project management and budgeting,
 though we do not take a project unless we can provide you all the expertise you will require.
